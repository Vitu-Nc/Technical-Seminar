# Project Progress Notes  
**Project:** Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) – Christofides Algorithm GUI  
**Language:** JavaScript (HTML Canvas)  
**Student:** Vitumbiko J Banda
**Date Started:** 22/10/25
**Repository:** https://github.com/Vitu-Nc/TSP-Christofides  

---

### 🧩 Week 1 – Initial Setup
- Created a new HTML file `tsp_christofides.html`
- Implemented a responsive canvas and control sidebar
- Added ability to place cities by clicking on the canvas
- Added “Run Christofides”, “Undo”, “Clear”, and “Random” buttons

**Challenges:** Learning basic canvas drawing and event handling  
**Next:** Implement MST logic using Prim’s algorithm

---

### ⚙️ – MST Implementation
- Added distance calculation between all city pairs
- Implemented Prim’s algorithm to build the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**
- Visualized MST in **green lines**
- Verified that tree connects all cities without forming cycles

**Next:** Detect odd-degree vertices and perform matching

---

### 🔶 Week 2 – Odd Vertices & Matching
- Identified all vertices with **odd degree** in MST
- Implemented **greedy matching** to connect odd vertices (orange dashed lines)
- Verified that all vertices now have even degree

**Next:** Generate Eulerian tour of multigraph

---

### 🔁 – Euler Tour & Shortcut
- Implemented **Hierholzer’s Algorithm** to produce Euler tour (gray path)
- Added **shortcutting step** to form Hamiltonian cycle (blue path)
- Calculated final tour distance and displayed statistics

**Next:** Improve UI toggles and optimize edge drawing

---

### 💡 Week 3 – User Interface & Documentation
- Added checkboxes to toggle visibility of MST, Matching, Euler, and Final Tour
- Added **Stats Panel** showing total points and tour lengths
- Added tooltips and progress notes for each step
- Created `PROGRESS.md` file for tracking updates

**Next:** Prepare presentation slides and GitHub Pages deployment

### 🪜 Future Enhancements
- Replace greedy matching with exact Blossom algorithm for true MWPM
- Add “Auto-animate” mode showing each phase dynamically
- Add data export to CSV (list of tour coordinates)
- Integrate with AI optimization (optional extension)
